# Advent Of Code snippets

I am trying to do AOC in Rust, but sometimes a problem has an interesting or generalizable solution that I would not be able to idiomatically do in Rust.

I just use python instead, and keep it here for future reference.

For example, AOC 2022-7 is a shell ls/cd -> AST parsing tool. I could use it in the future for some shell program.
