# Python Pet Projects
Kind of like a 'greenhouse' for my pet projects in python, that when grown, I might move one out into a repository of its own.

Please don't rely on anything here. If you'd like to suggest a feature/refactoring, make an issue. I probably won't accept pull requests (unless it's vulnerability/security-related) because this is partly educational (for me) as well.


## File Structure/Setup
Each individual project may have a README.md of its own.
